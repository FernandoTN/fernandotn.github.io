## Research Overview

As part of Stanford Graduate School of Business's MSx program (2025-2026), I am conducting in-depth research on Autonomous Language Models (ALMs) using the Research Driven Inspiration (RDI) framework. This systematic, curiosity-driven approach focuses on gaining deep domain expertise and uncovering hidden insights in the rapidly evolving ALM landscape.

## Research Focus

Autonomous Language Models represent an emerging frontier in AI â€“ systems powered by large language models that can act with high degrees of independence. Unlike traditional chatbots that simply respond to prompts, ALMs are "AI doers" capable of proactively pursuing goals and executing multi-step tasks autonomously.

Key research areas include:

- **ALM capabilities and limitations** across different business contexts
- **Technical evolution** from language understanding to autonomous action
- **Industry adoption patterns** and implementation challenges
- **Business model implications** for organizations deploying ALMs
- **Regulatory and ethical considerations** for autonomous AI systems

## Research Methodology (RDI Framework)

### Core Research Components

The Stanford RDI framework emphasizes primary research and pattern recognition to identify non-obvious opportunities. My ALM research consists of four integrated components:

#### 1. Primary Market Research

**Industry Expert Interviews**

- Engaging with AI researchers, entrepreneurs, and enterprise adopters
- Understanding real-world ALM implementation challenges and successes
- Gathering firsthand perspectives on future ALM capabilities

#### 2. Technology Landscape Analysis

**ALM Ecosystem Mapping**

- Tracking key players (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Microsoft)
- Analyzing open-source frameworks (AutoGPT, LangChain, Semantic Kernel)
- Identifying emerging platforms and tools enabling autonomous AI

#### 3. Use Case Analysis

**Business Application Research**

- Identifying real-world ALM deployment scenarios across industries
- Analyzing ROI and value proposition for different use cases
- Understanding implementation barriers and success factors

#### 4. Pattern Recognition and Hypothesis Development

**Forward-Looking Analysis**

- Developing hypotheses about ALM evolution over 2-3 years
- Identifying non-obvious opportunities in the ALM landscape
- Connecting healthcare industry insights with AI autonomous capabilities
