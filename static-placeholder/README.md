This folder documents that a previous standalone `index.html` placeholder was removed from the repository root to avoid conflicts with the Next.js app.

If you still need to serve a static placeholder separately (e.g., for a different host), keep it here or in another branch. The full site is built from the Next.js app via static export to `out/`.

Original `index.html` remains available in git history.
